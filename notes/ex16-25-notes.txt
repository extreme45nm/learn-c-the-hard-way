ex17 HEAP & STACK allocation

	Heap vs Stack allocation

		Stack : for temporary variable, these variable was created by the function and be used locally inside that function so we can call them as LOCAL VARIABLE.
		these kind of variable pops out automatically after the function had done its work to PREVENT MEM LEAKs.

		Heap: for malloc()
